# Patch my Street
## Report anything that needs to be repaired

Welcome to Patch my Street.
This is an Open Source project to help people report to their municipalities common street problems such as potholes, street lights not working, trash on the street, abandoned vehicles, etc.

The users locate problems using either an address or a pin in a map. The app then creates and forwards the occurence to the correct authority.

In future versions, users will be able to see on the map the existing occurences and notify the authority if the issue is not solved yet.
Authorities will be able to clear occurences once they are solved.
